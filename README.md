# IOT-Hacking
IoT hacking with MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) involves exploiting vulnerabilities in IoT devices that use MQTT as a communication protocol. MQTT is lightweight and commonly used for device-to-cloud communications in IoT environments due to its efficiency. However, its simplicity can also lead to security weaknesses if not properly configured or implemented.

# Information Gathering
The second part of this project involves some basic imformation gathering
